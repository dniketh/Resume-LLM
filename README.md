Resume-LLM

Resume-LLM is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) model developed for a project proposal to analyze and rank resumes based on specific job descriptions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, this tool enhances the recruitment process by providing context-aware resume evaluations.

Features
	•	Automated Resume Analysis: Evaluates resumes against job descriptions to determine relevance.
	•	Context-Aware Ranking: Uses LLMs and vector search (FAISS/Pinecone/OpenSearch) to rank resumes based on content and context.
